I am a full-stack web developer who thrives in owning projects from initial concept through implementation and delivery of a complete solution.  I enjoy working with stakeholders to identify detailed business requirements and translating that logic into solid database design and extensible code.  I am both a code person and a people person, and I am most gratified to see my applications in action supporting my colleagues in their daily work.
